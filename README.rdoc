== README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version 2.1.1

* This app uses a Sidekiq worker for mailing negatives, if deploying on Heroku you will need an extra dyno for Sidekiq

* Clone repo, bundle install(there is a procfile that runs the bundle exec sidekiq command)
